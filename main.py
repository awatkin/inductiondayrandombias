''' 
Random Library Bias Assessment

This is the base code for you to fill out and complete. 

The Challenges to complete:

1: Ask the user how many times they want to roll the dice, roll the dice that many times and report the results back. 

2. Ask the user how many repeats of the test to do as well as the number of times to roll. Report the results

3. Assess the results to say which number is the highest, by how much, the smallest number, and if you can, 
if you feel the library is bias.
