# Induction Day Random Bias
This is a base code and solutions for students work on assess bias in random libraries as an introduction to Python in general. 

Through working on the tasks below, you will learn about:

- Python in general, from a beginners point of view
- commenting code as examples are included in it
- Taking user input
- Using variables
- Using iteration
- Using lists
- Using selection

##Random Number Bias

Python, like many languages has a large number of included libraries. Like many other languages there is a random number generating library. 

But, just how random is the random number library. We are going to create code, to roll a six sided dice to assess the bias of the standard random library. 

##Tasks

In this code, there are 3 challenges to attempt:

###Challenge 1

Take a user input for how many times to roll the D6 dice. Record, using a list, the number of times each number is rolled and then out put the results. 

###Challenege 2

In this task, alter your code to take in both a number of times to roll the D6, followed by a number of times to repeat the test. 
Record the results into a list and output the results at the end. 

###Challenege 3

Alter your code once more to also tell the user the breakdown of the results including:

- Which was the most common number
- which was the lowest number
- By how much the highest number was the highest number

And, if you feel like you can implement it:

- An assessment on if you think there is biased shown in the results
